This is an example approach to have all help patches from https://github.com/pure-data/pure-data/tree/master/doc/5.reference converted to an easy html. This in turn can simplify translations. (it will take much work to create the initial english htmls).

The translator just copies the source html file and paste it on the corresponding language folder. Then he/she just open the file in a text editor and translates everything inside the html tags `<h2>`, `<p>` and `<pre>`.

Files can live in the pure-data github repo under a special https://pages.github.com/. so this is the server and also the repo for PRs.

----------------

Files here can be browsed via https://lucarda.github.io./ . You can test how it renders on the Desktop, tablet or Phone.
