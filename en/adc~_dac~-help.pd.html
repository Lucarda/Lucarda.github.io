<h2>[adc~] [dac~] audio I/O </h2>

<p>adc~ and dac~ provide real-time audio input and output for Pd, respectively, whether analog or digital. By default they are stereo (with channel numbers 1, 2) but you can specify different channel numbers as in:</p>

<pre>

[adc~ 5]  (input from channel 5 only)

[dac~ 1 2 5 23]  (output to channels 1, 2, 5, and 23)

</pre>



<p>The actual number of channels Pd inputs and outputs is set on Pd's command line or in the "audio settings" dialog. You can open patches that want to use more channels, and channel numbers out of range will be dropped (dac~) or appear as zero (adc~).</p>

<pre>

[set 5( 
|
[dac~ 1]  

</pre>

<p>The "set" message to either dac~ or adc~ resets the channel or channels. This requires Pd to restart DSP and so should only be done at setup time, not while audio is being computed.</p>

<p>If more than one dac~ outputs to the same channel, the signals are added. More than one adc~ may read the same input channel.</p>
